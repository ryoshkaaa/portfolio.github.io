During this time, I won numerous city and international competitions, became part of the national team, and participated in various training camps and trips. My favorite climbing discipline was speed climbing, where the goal is to ascend a 15-meter wall faster than anyone else. This discipline perfectly matches my explosive personality. I believe that my sports career strengthened both my character and body, and the benefits I gained from it continue to bring me many advantages to this day.<h2>

I immediately applied. To participate, I needed to write a motivational essay and submit my portfolio, which I did. I knew there would be many applicants and fierce competition, so imagine my joy when, a month later, I found out that I had won the grant and could attend completely free of charge!</h2>
                <h2> After the trip, I was left with my own project, many new friends from all over the world, photos, and most importantly, knowledge and skills in various fields. During those two weeks, I not only learned everything about wind energy and how to work in 3D, but I also met renowned Russian scientists, attended their lectures, and tried a variety of activities, such as clay sculpting and making cotton candy. I also got to explore the capital of my homeland.</h2>
