The competition consists of three challenging parts: a 50-question test on Chinese culture, history, and literature with a 25-minute time limit, a speech and essay about myself, and a creative performance in Chinese, such as a dance or song. At the city level, I earned 3rd place, and at the regional stage, I received a special prize for the best speechâ€”an honor uniquely awarded by the jury.  </h2>

            <h2> From the age of 10 to 15, I dedicated myself to a sports career in climbing. During this time, I won numerous city and international competitions, joined the national team, and participated in various training camps and trips. My favorite discipline was speed climbing, where the goal is to ascend a 15-meter wall as quickly as possible. I believe that my sports career strengthened both my character and body, and the lessons I learned from it like strong work ethics and teamwork continue to benefit me to this day. <h2>

                <h1> 4. Participant in MIPT Summer Project School "Hello, Russia"  </h1>
                <h2>Earlier this year, I applied for a grant competition organized by Rossotrudnichestvo and MIPT for a two-week summer program at a technopark. The application process required a motivational essay and a detailed portfolio. Despite fierce competition, I was thrilled to secure the grant, allowing me to attend the program free of charge. <br>
			<br>
			During the program, I gained invaluable knowledge and hands-on skills in fields such as wind energy and 3D modeling. I also had the privilege of meeting renowned Russian scientists, attending their lectures, and exploring the capital of my homeland. Beyond academics, I participated in creative activities like clay sculpting and even made cotton candy! By the end of the program, I was awarded "Best Media Product" for a creative video I produced during the camp. This experience left me with not only a finished project and new skills but also lifelong memories and friendships from around the world.
